> **Dataset Introduction**: The White Wine Quality dataset is a public dataset 
that was created by Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho), Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando 
Almeida, Telmo Matos and Jose Reis (CVRVV) @ 2009. This tidy data set contains 
4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of 
each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a 
rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

# Univariate Plots Section

## Dataset overview

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}

str(ww)

```

The dataset contains 4898 obs. of  13 variables; these variables are either in 
numeric or integar format.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww)

```

Summary command provides a quick look of the structure of each variable.

## Closer looks at uni-variables

#### create_hist function
As taking closer looks at each variables I will need to create multiple plots, 
it will be great to define plotting function to reduce repetitive works. In 
below chunk I define a function which takes in variable name along with plot 
title, and outputs histogram.

```{r }

create_hist <- function(variable, title) {
  return(ggplot(data = ww, aes_string(x = variable)) +
                  geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = '#7faeff') +
                  ggtitle(title) +
                  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
}

```

#### zoom_hist function
Also, considering there's a possibility to zoom in histogram, I create a 
function that takes axis limits and breaks for future use.

```{r }

zoom_hist <- function(variable, binwidth, xlim_start, xlim_end, br_start, br_end, br_gap, title) {
  if (missing(xlim_start)) {return(ggplot(data = ww, aes_string(x = variable)) +
           geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = '#7faeff', binwidth = binwidth) +
           scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(br_start, br_end, br_gap)) +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
           ggtitle(title))}
  else {
  return(ggplot(data = ww, aes_string(x = variable)) +
           geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = '#7faeff', binwidth = binwidth) +
           coord_cartesian(xlim = c(xlim_start, xlim_end)) +
           scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(br_start, br_end, br_gap)) +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
           ggtitle(title)) 
}}

```

### Quality

Since the main concern for this dataset is the quality of white wine, it would 
be a good idea to see how wines are rated at different ratings. As plot in 
below shows, there are no wines being rated at 0, 1, 2, and 10 points, while 
there are 2,000+ records are rated at 6.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(quality), data = ww) +
  geom_bar(color = 'black',fill = '#f4c141') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 1))

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$quality)

```

Looking at the quantile of white wine quality, it may be a good idea to cluster 
quality into three groups (high:7-9, low:3-5, medium:6) as quality.level for 
future analysis convenience. By clustering, the original 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ww$quality.level <- cut(ww$quality, breaks = c(2,5,6,9), labels = c('low','medium','high'))
table(ww$quality.level)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(quality.level), data = ww) +
  geom_bar(color = 'black',fill = '#f4c141')

```

### fixed.acidity

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$fixed.acidity)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

create_hist('fixed.acidity', 'fixed.acidity counts')

```

Looking at the plot and summary, we can see that majority for wines have 
fixed.acidity between 6.3 and 7.3. 

### volatile.acidity

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$volatile.acidity)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

va.plot <- create_hist('volatile.acidity', 'volatile.acidity counts')
va.plot.zoomed <- zoom_hist('volatile.acidity', 0.01, 0.08, 0.4, 0, 0.5, 0.05, 'volatile.acidity counts: zoomed')
grid.arrange(va.plot, va.plot.zoomed, ncol=2)

```

(left plot) Most of the volatile.acidity fall between 0.21 and 0.32, while there
is a peak around 0.26: more than 975 wines have volatile.acidity at this rate.

(right plot) Zooming in to most data are at by adding breaks and adjusting 
binwidte to see if I can find anything different. 
Looks like there's not a volatile.acidity that is with significantly more wines 
in particular.

### citric.acid

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$citric.acid)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ca.plot <- create_hist('citric.acid', 'citric.acid counts')
ca.plot.zoomed <- zoom_hist('citric.acid', 0.01, 0.1, 0.4, 0, 0.5, 0.05,'citric.acid counts: zoomed')
grid.arrange(ca.plot, ca.plot.zoomed, ncol=2)

```

(left plot) Similar to volatile.acidity, there's also a peak for citric.acid. 
Also we can see citric.acid is basically bell-shaped-distributed.

(right plot) Zoomed in to see if there's something different: When changed 
binwidth, we can see there are still two peaks (0.28 & 0.3) for citric.acid.

### residual.sugar

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$residual.sugar)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

rs.plot <- create_hist('residual.sugar', 'residual.sugar counts')
rs.plot.zoomed <- zoom_hist('residual.sugar', 0.2, 0.5, 5, 0, 5, 0.5, 'residual.sugar counts: zoomed')
grid.arrange(rs.plot, rs.plot.zoomed, ncol=2)

```

From plots above it is found that 1.2 & 1.4 are the two peaks of residual.sugar.

### chlorides

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$chlorides)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

chl.plot <- create_hist('chlorides', 'chlorides counts')
chl.plot.zoomed <- zoom_hist('chlorides', 0.005, 0, 0.06, 0, 0.06, 0.01, 'chlorides counts: zoomed')
grid.arrange(chl.plot, chl.plot.zoomed, ncol=2)

```

Looks like the values of chlorides are centered around 0.035~0.05, which can 
also be seen in summary table above.

### free.sulfur.dioxide

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

fsd.plot <- create_hist('free.sulfur.dioxide', 'free.sulfur.dioxide counts')
fsd.plot.zoomed <- zoom_hist('free.sulfur.dioxide', 5, 1,50, 1, 50, 10 ,'free.sulfur.dioxide counts: zoomed')
grid.arrange(fsd.plot, fsd.plot.zoomed, ncol=2)

```

### total.sulfur.dioxide

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

tsd.plot <- create_hist('total.sulfur.dioxide', 'total.sulfur.dioxide counts')
tsd.plot.zoomed <- zoom_hist('total.sulfur.dioxide', 5, 90, 180, 90, 180, 10,'total.sulfur.dioxide counts: zoomed')
grid.arrange(tsd.plot, tsd.plot.zoomed, ncol=2)

```

Seems there's a peak around 130. From  the zoomed graph above we can see that 
there'not a particular total.sulfur.dioxide level that is with significantly 
more wines than others.

### density

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$density)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

create_hist('density', 'density counts')

```

### pH

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$pH)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

create_hist('pH', 'pH counts')

```

total.sulfur.dioxide, density and pH are all bell-shaped distributed.

### sulphates

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$sulphates)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

sulphates.plot <- create_hist('sulphates', 'sulphates counts') 
sulphates.plot.zoomed <- zoom_hist('sulphates', 0.01, 0.2, 0.6, 0, 0.6, 0.1, 'sulphates counts: zoomed')
grid.arrange(sulphates.plot, sulphates.plot.zoomed, ncol=2)

```

There are two higher frequencies for sulphates. This seems to correlate to the 
log10-transformed residual.sugar - we can look these two variables together 
later on.

From the zoomed plot above we can see the 0.5 level has slightly more wines than
other levels.

### alcohol

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

summary(ww$alcohol)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

alcohol.plot <- create_hist('alcohol', 'alcohol counts')
alcohol.plot.zoomed <- zoom_hist('alcohol', 0.1, , , 8, 14, 1, 'alcohol counts: zoomed')
grid.arrange(alcohol.plot, alcohol.plot.zoomed, ncol=2)

```


(Left plot) There doesn't seem to be a evident distribution for alcohol at the 
first glance, so I try adjusting binwidth to see if there's more findings.
(Right plot) 9.4 & 9.5 have more wines than other levels. 

### Additional plots for univariables

During the plotting process, I found that
a) volatile.acidity
b) citric.acid
c) residual.sugar
d) chlorides
e) free.sulfur.dioxide
are all skewed to the right, with some outliers at the right of x axis. I am 
curious of how these variables will look like when they are adjusted by log10, 
so I plot the below. For variables that cannot be observed clearly in overlaid 
desity plot, I will create additional desity plots separately to look into.

#### a) volatile.acidity

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

compare_var_log10 <- function(variable) {
  var_log10 <- log10(ww[variable])
  colnames(var_log10) <- paste('log10', toString(variable))
  merged <- merge(melt(ww[variable]),melt(var_log10), all=TRUE)
  return(ggplot(merged,aes(x=value, fill=variable)) + geom_density(alpha=0.25) + theme(legend.position="bottom") + xlab(variable)+
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()))
}

compare_var_log10('volatile.acidity')

```

#### b) citric.acid

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

compare_var_log10('citric.acid')

```

#### c) residual.sugar

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

c <- compare_var_log10('residual.sugar') 
c1 = ggplot(aes(residual.sugar), data = ww) +
  geom_density(color = 'black', fill = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) 
c2 = ggplot(aes(residual.sugar), data = ww) +
  geom_density(color = 'black', fill = '#4cefc9', alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() + xlab('log10 residual.sugar')
grid.arrange(c, c1, c2, nrow=3)

```

#### d) chlorides

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

d <- compare_var_log10('chlorides')
d1 = ggplot(aes(chlorides), data = ww) +
  geom_density(color = 'black', fill = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) 
d2 = ggplot(aes(chlorides), data = ww) +
  geom_density(color = 'black', fill = '#4cefc9', alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() + xlab('log10 chlorides')
grid.arrange(d, d1, d2, nrow=3)

```

#### e) free.sulfur.dioxidec) residual.sugar

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

e <- compare_var_log10('free.sulfur.dioxide')
e1 = ggplot(aes(free.sulfur.dioxide), data = ww) +
  geom_density(color = 'black', fill = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) 
e2 = ggplot(aes(free.sulfur.dioxide), data = ww) +
  geom_density(color = 'black', fill = '#4cefc9', alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() + xlab('log10 free.sulfur.dioxide')
grid.arrange(e, e1, e2, nrow=3)


```

Looking at the few plots above, it is interesting to found that the 
distribution shape for residual.sugar looks quite different after taking log10 -
it is transformed from one-peak bell to two-peak shape.

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?

The dataset contains 4898 observation with 11 input and 1 output variables:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1. fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
   2. volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
   3. citric acid (g / dm^3)
   4. residual sugar (g / dm^3)
   5. chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
   6. free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
   7. total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
   8. density (g / cm^3)
   9. pH
   10. sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
   11. alcohol (% by volume)
   
Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12. quality (score between 0 and 10)

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The main feature of interest in this dataset is quality. I am curious about what
is the key contributor(s) (what input variables) to a wine's quality score.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your \
investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

To my understanding, the eleven variables will support the investigation of 
white wine quality. However at this stage of data exploration, there doesn't 
seem to be an evident clue on which variable have a more reliability with the 
quality.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

I created quality.level to cluster the main feature, quality, into three groups, 
so that converting quality field from numeric to factor. This new variable may
come handy in the following analsis.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \
Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \
of the data? If so, why did you do this?

As I commented in captions above, some of the variables are skewed to the right,
so I performed log10 on x axis to see if there's any more findings. It turns out
that residual.sugar was transformed to have two peaks instead of one peak that 
is observed in the skewed distribution.
For most of variables, I did a zoom in to the peak of distribution by adding a 
coord_cartesian and adjusting binwidth to closely see if there's any certain 
level that really have more wines fall into. 

# Bivariate Plots Section

To see how different variables correlates with each other and whether a variable 
is a input or output variable, it's a good idea to plot a correlation matrix.
We don't need to see correlation of some variables, such as 'X' and 
'quality.level', so I omit them from the correlation matrix.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}

vars <- c('fixed.acidity', 'volatile.acidity', 'citric.acid', 'residual.sugar', 'chlorides', 'free.sulfur.dioxide', 'total.sulfur.dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', 'quality')
ww.cor <- cor(ww[vars])
corrplot(ww.cor, type = 'lower', method = 'shade',
         order='hclust', sig.level = 0.01, insig = 'blank')

```

Running codes above we can find the top and bottom pairs of variables that is 
more related to each others. It seems residual.sugar and sulphates don't 
correlates as I expected earlier. 

density & residual.sugar:
0.83896645

quality & alcohol:
0.435574715

total.sulfur.dioxide & residual.sugar: 
0.40143931

pH & fixed.acidity:
-0.425858291

total.sulfur.dioxide & alcohol:
-0.4488921

residual.sugar & alcohol:
-0.45063122

density & alcohol:
-0.78013762

Looking at the correlations, I found that alcohol seems to positively affect the
quality of wines, while there are three other variables(density, residual.sugar,
total.sulfur.dioxide) that negatively affect alcohol. Interestingly, the three 
variables seems to positively correlate to each other, as shown in graph below.

![Correlation between varibles (part)](Picture1.png)


### alcohol & quality

As quality is the main feature we want to explore, let's start with plotting 
relationship between 1) alcohol and quality, and 2) density and quality, as they 
are the two variables that have relatively higher correlation with quality.
This is the time when quality.level comes into use.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(quality.level, alcohol)) +
  geom_boxplot() 

```

From plot above we can see for higher quality wines, the alcohol percentage is 
generally higher (the box is moving higher the y-axis).

### density & quality

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(density))+
  geom_density(aes(color = quality.level)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$density, 0.01), quantile(ww$density, 0.99))) +
  ggtitle('Density Plot of Wines at Different Quality Levels') + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  xlab('Density (g / cm^3)') 

```

Seeing plot above, we can find that for higher quality wines, the density tend 
to be lower - there seemes to be a negative relationship between density and 
quality, same as what is observed in correstion matrix.

Next, since quality are correlated to alcohol, let's look at the relationships 
of the three variables that we found negatively-related to alcohol (density, 
residual.sugar, total.sulfur.dioxide) and alcohol. 

### alcohol & density

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(alcohol, density)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.01), quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.99)),
                  ylim = c(quantile(ww$density, 0.01), quantile(ww$density, 0.99))) +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')

```

The negative relationship between alcohol and density is quite evident in plot 
above.

### alcohol & residual.sugar

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(alcohol, residual.sugar)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.01), quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.99)),
                  ylim = c(quantile(ww$residual.sugar, 0.01), quantile(ww$residual.sugar, 0.99))) +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')

```

Though residual.sugar and alcohol are negatively-correlated, there are many data
points that are with less than 2.5 residual.sugar.

### alcohol & total.sulfur.dioxide

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(alcohol, total.sulfur.dioxide)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.01), quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.99)),
                  ylim = c(quantile(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide, 0.01), quantile(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide, 0.99)))+ stat_smooth(method = 'lm')

```

The plot above proves the negative relationship between alcohol and 
total.sulfur.dioxide.

### density & residual.sugar

From correlation matrix plotted earlier, we see that density and residual.sugar
have close, positive relationship with each other. I am curious how that 
relationship will look like on a scatterplot.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(density, residual.sugar)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$density, 0.01), quantile(ww$density, 0.99)),
                  ylim = c(quantile(ww$residual.sugar, 0.01), quantile(ww$residual.sugar, 0.99))) +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')

```

### pH & fixed.acidity

pH & fixed.acidity are also in the list of pairs that are closely-related 
variables, let's plot the two variables on a scatterplot.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(pH, fixed.acidity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$pH, 0.01), quantile(ww$pH, 0.99)),
                  ylim = c(quantile(ww$fixed.acidity, 0.01), quantile(ww$fixed.acidity, 0.99))) +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')

```

The distribution of points looks funny; it's because fixed.acidity is not 
continuous in the dataset.

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in \
the dataset?

The feature of interest (quality) only evidently related to alcohol from the 
first glance of correlation matrix.
I also found that the relationships among alcohol and density, residual.sugar,
total.sulfur.dioxide are interesting - they seem to be connected to each other 
in some way.


### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features \
(not the main feature(s) of interest)?

Other than the relationships of alcohol, density, residual.sugar, and 
total.sulfur.dioxide, pH & fixed.acidity also have negative relationships.

### What was the strongest relationship you found?

The strongest relationship I found among these variables is density and 
residual.sugar, they have a 0.83896645 correlation.
Density also have strong negative relationship with alcohol, the correlation is
-0.78013762.

# Multivariate Plots Section

From investigation in sections before, I found that:
a) Alcohol and density are negatively related
b) Density and residual.sugar are negatively related
and 
c) Quality and alcohol are positively related

In this section I would like to blend quality into findings a) and b) above to 
see if there's any new, complex findings.

### alcohol & density, residual.sugar, total.sulfur.dioxide

With the findings in previous section, I want to see how the three variables
affect alcohol - a 3D scatter plot might help.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}

fourvar <- plot_ly(ww, x = ~density, y = ~residual.sugar, z = ~total.sulfur.dioxide, color = ~alcohol) %>%

The plot above proves that alcohol has a negative relationship with density, 
residual.sugar, and total.sulfur.dioxide: the lighter points means wines with
higher alcohol, and they are concentrated to corner where the three other 
variables are lower.

I am hence curious of how these variables interact with each other - maybe it's
a good idea to build a model to see how alcohol, density, residual.sugar and
total.sulfur.dioxide predicts quality.

### building model with alcohol, density, residual.sugar, total.sulfur.dioxide

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

m1 <- lm(formula=quality ~ alcohol , data=ww)
m2 <- update(m1, ~ . + density)
m3 <- update(m2, ~ . + residual.sugar)
m4 <- update(m3, ~ . + total.sulfur.dioxide)

summary(m4)

```

Judgingfrom the low r-square (less than 0.22), I would not see this model an
appropriate one to perdict quality.

### relationship among quality, density and alcohol

As the route of building models of the four variables to predict quality doesn't
seem to work, let's turn our eyes to look at how quality, density and alcohol
interacts with each other.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 

ggplot(data = ww, aes(alcohol, density)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = ww$quality.level)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.01), quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.99)),
                  ylim = c(quantile(ww$density, 0.01), quantile(ww$density, 0.99)))
  
```

It is discovered that the higher quality wines are centered in the high-alcohol,
low-density corner of the graph.


# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of \
looking at your feature(s) of interest?

In this part of investigation I created a 3d-scatterplot to include in four 
variables to validate the observation that alcohol is negatively correlated to
density, residual.sugar and total.sulfur.dioxide; the plot proves the relation-
ship to be true.
The density-alcohol scatterplot colored with quality level strengthened each 
other on the negative relationship with quality.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

I am a bit surprised to find that the model build does not fit my initial 
assumption that plugging in some variables that are correlated to each other
would output a not-bad prediction.

### Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the \
strengths and limitations of your model.

I created a model with alcohol, density, residual.sugar and total.sulfur.dioxide
as input variable to predict wine quality. The result is not satisfactory as 
r-square of the model  is less than 0.22. In my perspective the limitation 
probably comes from the low correlation of these variables with quality.

# Final Plots and Summary

### Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Plot_One}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(x = quality.level, y = alcohol)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = '#cc8be5') +
  ggtitle('Alcohol Distribution for Different Quality Levels') + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylab('Alcohol(% by volume)')

```

### Description One

Grouping quality into three levels (low, medium, high) and display their alcohol 
level in boxplots respectively, we can see that higher quality wines tend to 
have higer alcohol.


### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Plot_Two}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(density, residual.sugar)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10, color = 'orange') +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$density, 0.01), quantile(ww$density, 0.99)),
                  ylim = c(quantile(ww$residual.sugar, 0.01), quantile(ww$residual.sugar, 0.99))) +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm', color = '#d67022') +
  ggtitle('Relationship Between Density and Residual Sugar') + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  xlab('density (g / cm^3)') +
  ylab('residual sugar (g / dm^3)')

```

### Description Two

Though the main feature, quality is not included in this plot, but I found it 
interesting that density actually has a high correlation with residual sugar
in white wines - this could be observed in the relatively steep slope-smoother
and the datapoints distribution in plot above.

### Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Plot_Three}

ggplot(data = ww, aes(alcohol, density)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = ww$quality.level)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.01), quantile(ww$alcohol, 0.99)),
                  ylim = c(quantile(ww$density, 0.01), quantile(ww$density, 0.99))) +
  ggtitle('Relationship Among Quality, Alcohol and Density') + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  xlab('Alcohol(% by volume)') +
  ylab('Density (g / cm^3)')

```

### Description Three

Apparently there's more factors affecting quality than just alcohol. Since 
density is the second evident single variable that correlates to quality, I've
maken this plot to see the relationship among these three variables. From the
plot we can see higher quality white wines generally have lower density and 
higher alcohol.

# Reflection

During the process of analyzing this dataset, I found myself struggling with
plotting numeric variables: the plots looks funny and I could not find any 
insights from these plots. I spent lots of time trying differnt plot types and
force myself to come up with thoughts interpreting these plots but in vain. 
After several hours of struggle I try referring to how others process datasets
and found that creating new variables could turn numeric inputs into factors - 
this helped me a lot and I can progress further by clustering quality into three
levels. I believe what I did right is reach out for reference.

Another lesson learned is that I shouldn't have been stubborn looking at the
relationships of alcohol, density, residual.sugar and total.sulfur.dioxide - it
took much more time than expected to find they are not really contributing much
to the feature variable.

To make the analysis better, in the future I would consider obeserving how 
some other variables distribute differently among the three quality levels.
